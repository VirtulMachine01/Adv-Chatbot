Here is a simple example of how you might implement this using a singly linked list:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct Node {\n    int data;\n    Node* next;\n};\n\nvoid insertAtEnd(Node** head, int newData) {\n    Node* newNode = new Node();\n    newNode->data = newData;\n    newNode->next = nullptr;\n\n    if (*head == nullptr) {\n        *head = newNode;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Node* lastNode = *head;\n    while (lastNode->next != nullptr) {\n        lastNode = lastNode->next;\n    }\n    lastNode->next = newNode;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    Node* head = nullptr;\n    int size = 5;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\n        int data = i + 1;\n        insertAtEnd(&head, data);\n    }\n\n    Node* currentNode = head;\n    while (currentNode != nullptr) {\n        cout << \" \" << currentNode->data;\n        currentNode = currentNode->next;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Node` structure with an integer data field and a pointer to the next node. The `insertAtEnd` function takes a head pointer to the linked list and the new data as arguments, creates a new node with that data, and inserts it at the end of the list. In the `main` function, we create a linked list of size 5 and print out its contents.\n\nI hope this helps!
