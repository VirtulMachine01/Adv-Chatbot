It is not a standard Python module, and I couldn't find any information about it. \n\nHowever, I can suggest a different approach to record audio in Python. You can use the `pyaudio` and `wave` modules to record and save audio files.\n\nHere's an example code to get you started:\n\n```\nimport pyaudio\nimport wave\n\n# Set chunk size of 1024 samples per data frame\nchunk = 1024  \n\n# Sample format\nFORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16  \nchannels = 2  \nsample_rate = 44100  \nrecord_seconds = 5  \n\n# Initialize PyAudio object\np = pyaudio.PyAudio()  \n\n# Open stream object to write the recorded audio into\nstream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=channels, rate=sample_rate, input=True, frames_per_buffer=chunk)\n\nprint(\"Recording...\")\n\n# Start Recording\nframes = []\n\nfor i in range(int(sample_rate / chunk * record_seconds)):\n    data = stream.read(chunk)\n    frames.append(data)\n\nprint(\"Finished recording.\")\n\n# Stop Recording\nstream.stop_stream()\nstream.close()\np.terminate()\n\n# Save recorded data as a .wav file\nwaveFile = wave.open(\"recordedAudio.wav\", 'wb')\nwaveFile.setnchannels(channels)\nwaveFile.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT))\nwaveFile.setframerate(sample_rate)\nwaveFile.writeframes(b''.join(frames))\nwaveFile.close()\n```\n\nThis code will record audio for 5 seconds and save it as a .wav file. You can adjust the `record_seconds` variable to change the recording time.\n\nNote that you need to install the `pyaudio` module before running this code.

When you press Shift + Enter, the cursor will move to the next line, and the text will be wrapped accordingly.\n\nWhen you press the Submit button, the input text will be processed and displayed on the next line using `st.write`.\n\nNote that if you want to limit the number of lines or characters in the input field, you can use the `max_lines` or `max_chars` parameters of the `st.text_area` widget, respectively.

If both conditions are true, it submits the prompt by triggering the Submit button.\n\nWe then pass this function as the `on_key_press` argument to the `st.text_area` widget.
