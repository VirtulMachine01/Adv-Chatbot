The authors present a method called FUSECAP, which uses a combination of vision and language transformers to generate comprehensive and accurate captions.\n\nThe paper highlights the limitations of current approaches, which often produce multiple captions for different regions within an image, whereas FUSECAP generates a single descriptive caption for the entire image.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of FUSECAP by comparing its performance with current state-of-the-art models on various datasets. They also evaluate the generated captions using a voting system, where human evaluators rank the captions, and find that FUSECAP outperforms current models by an average of 29.7%.\n\nAdditionally, the authors assess the performance of FUSECAP in the image-text retrieval task, which involves matching images to text queries and vice versa. They find that the enriched data generated by FUSECAP improves the retrieval performance.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a new approach to generating enriched captions for images, which can lead to more accurate and comprehensive descriptions of visual content.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}, {"content": "so which datasets they used in this research?", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}, {"content": "According to the provided context, the researchers used the following datasets:\n\n1.
