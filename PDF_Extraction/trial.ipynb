      "Study materials For reference only Study and use the Code and Regulations carefully and make good use of them Engrave the Party rules and disciplines in the hearts of all Party members Office of the Discipline Inspection Commission of Northwestern Polytechnical University November 5, 2015 On October 18, 2015, the CPC Central Committee promulgated and implemented the newly revised Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China and the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China. On January 1, 2016, the promulgation and implementation of the Code and Regulations, the Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China and the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China will be formally implemented. It is a major measure to achieve the management and governance of the Party in accordance with regulations and strengthen the supervision within the Party under the conditions of the Party's long-term governance and comprehensive rule of law, reflecting the spirit of the 18th CPC National Congress and the Third and Fourth Plenary Sessions of the 18th CPC Central Committee and the practical results of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party. Recently, the General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued the \"Notice on Earnestly Studying and Implementing the Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China and the Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China\", requiring:  Fully understand the importance of studying and implementing the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\"  Earnestly organize the study, publicity and education of the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\"  Effectively implement the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" On October 29, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued the \"Notice\", requiring:  Take the study and implementation of the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" as an important starting point for implementing the requirements of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party  Reflect the study and implementation of the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" in the whole process of supervision, discipline enforcement and accountability  Strengthen supervision and inspection of the study and implementation of the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\"  Consciously set an example in studying and implementing the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" I. The significance of studying the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" II. The revision of the \"Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China\" III. The revision of the \"Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Communist Party of China\" IV. The relationship between the \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" V. Several requirements (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism Requirements for governing the country: The key to running China's affairs lies in the Party. To govern the country, we must first govern the Party, and we must govern the Party strictly. At present, we are facing the severe challenges of weakened Party leadership, lax organization and lax discipline. Strengthening discipline building is the fundamental solution to comprehensively and strictly governing the Party. Requirements of the development of the times: The newly revised \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" summarize and extract the practical achievements of strictly governing the Party since the 18th National Congress, transform them into moral and disciplinary requirements, and realize the advancement of the construction of Party regulations with the times. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism Requirements for strictly governing the Party: Comprehensively and strictly governing the Party inevitably requires the combination of governing the Party according to regulations and governing the Party with virtue. The newly revised \"Code\" and \"Regulations\" embody the unity of governing the Party according to regulations and governing the Party with virtue. Requirements for governing the school according to law: In-depth study and implementation of the two Party regulations, improve the school governance system, enhance the school governance capacity, and escort the school to formulate and implement the \"13th Five-Year Plan\" development plan and the school's long-term development. 1. The significance of studying the Code and Regulations 2. The revision of the Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China 3. Study content: Revision of the \"Regulations\" IV. The relationship between the \"Code\" and the \"Regulations\" V. Several requirements (I) Issues at the institutional and mechanism level The original \"Code of Conduct for Integrity\" was revised on the basis of the \"Several Codes for Integrity in the Administration of Party Members and Leading Cadres of the Communist Party of China (Trial)\" in 1997, and was promulgated and implemented in January 2010. The scope of application is too narrow - it only sets standards for party member leading cadres and fails to cover all more than 87 million party members. Lack of positive advocacy - the \"8 prohibitions\" and \"52 prohibitions\" are both \"negative lists\", and many clauses are repeated in the \"Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the Party\" and national laws before the revision. The theme of \"integrity\" is not prominent enough - some content has no direct connection with the theme of integrity. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism Before revision After revision 3 8 281 4 parts 18 articles More than 3,600 words Part Articles Words CPC Party member leading cadres Name Code of Conduct for Honesty and Self-discipline of the CPC Several Codes for Honest Administration of Government General Provisions Chapter I Code of Conduct for Honest Administration of Government Code of Honesty and Self-discipline of CPC Party Members Framework Chapter II Implementation and Supervision Code of Honesty and Self-discipline of CPC Party Member Leading Cadres Chapter III Supplementary Provisions (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism “Five highlights”  Closely follow honesty and self-discipline, and remove articles that are not directly related to it. 8 52  Adhere to positive advocacy, and move the relevant contents of the negative list of “individual prohibitions” and “individual prohibitions” into the “Regulations on Disciplinary Actions of the CPC” which was revised simultaneously.  Expand from Party member leading cadres to all Party members, fully reflecting the requirements of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party.  Highlight the key minority, focus on Party member leading cadres, and put forward higher requirements than ordinary Party members.  Simplify and simplify, so that all Party members can understand and remember easily. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism “Four musts” Must firmly uphold the communist ideal and the belief in socialism with Chinese characteristics; Must uphold the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; Must inherit and carry forward the fine traditions and style of the Party; Must consciously cultivate noble moral sentiments, strive to promote the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, be honest and self-disciplined, accept supervision, and always maintain the advanced nature and purity of the Party. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism “Eight norms” Norms for honesty and self-discipline of Party members Norms for honesty and self-discipline of Party member leading cadres (4 pairs of relationships) (4 dimensions) Adhere to the distinction between public and private, put public interests first and private interests second, be honest in politics, and consciously maintain the people’s fundamental interests. Adhere to frugality and avoid extravagance, live a simple and frugal life, be honest in self-cultivation, and consciously improve ideological and moral realm. Adhere to the principle of enduring hardships first and enjoying later, be honest and clean, and consciously take the lead in establishing Article 4 Article 8 Be willing to make sacrifices. Good family traditions. 1. The significance of studying the \"Guidelines\" and \"Regulations\" II. Revision of the Code of Conduct for Integrity and Self-discipline of the Communist Party of China III. Revision of the Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China IV. Relationship between the Code and the Regulations V. Several requirements (I) Issues at the institutional and mechanism level The original Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China were revised on the basis of the 1997 Regulations on Disciplinary Punishment of the Communist Party of China (Trial) and were promulgated and implemented in December 2003. The main problems are: There is a lack of necessary and serious accountability for violations of the Party Constitution and violations that undermine the authority of the Party Constitution. There is no distinction between discipline and law, and nearly half of the provisions are repeated in national laws such as the Criminal Law. Legal norms applicable to all citizens are used as disciplinary standards for party organizations and party members, which lowers the requirements for party organizations and party members. It is necessary to institutionalize the practical achievements of strict party governance since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and include the contents of strict political discipline and political rules, organizational discipline, implementation of the spirit of the Central Committee's eight regulations, and opposition to the \"four winds\" in the regulations. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism: Highlight the characteristics of a political party, the Party adheres to the separation of discipline and law, and seeks to be specific in dealing with violations of discipline and conduct. Since the 18th National Congress, the Party has put the Party Constitution before the law, and has put discipline and political rules before the law. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism: Overall changes after the revision of the Regulations: Provisions that were ignored or omitted in the past have been added, and the contents of strict governance of the Party, strict political discipline and political rules, organizational discipline, the spirit of the Central Committee's eight regulations, and opposition to the \"four tendencies\" since the 18th National Congress have been included in the revised disciplinary regulations. 79 provisions in the original regulations that are repeated in laws and regulations have been deleted, and replaced with special provisions such as Party organizations and members must \"exemplarily abide by national laws and regulations\" and Party organizations and members \"who violate national laws and regulations\" \"must be held accountable\", so as to achieve the separation of Party discipline and national law while effectively connecting them. The 10 types of disciplinary violations stipulated in the current regulations have been integrated and revised into 6 categories, which are divided into penalties for violations of political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, mass discipline, work discipline, and life discipline. (I) Issues at the institutional and mechanism level Before revision After revision 3 volumes 12 chapters 178 articles More than 24,000 words 3 volumes 11 chapters 133 articles More than 17,000 words Volume 1 General provisions Volume 1 General provisions Chapter 1 Guiding ideology, principles and scope of application Chapter 1 Guiding ideology, principles and scope of application Chapter 2 Violations of discipline and disciplinary sanctions Chapter 2 Violations of discipline and disciplinary sanctions Chapter 3 Rules for the application of disciplinary sanctions Chapter 3 Rules for the application of disciplinary sanctions Chapter 4 Disciplinary sanctions for Party members who violate laws and commit crimes Chapter 4 Disciplinary sanctions for Party members who violate laws and commit crimes Chapter 5 Other provisions Chapter 5 Other provisions Volume 2 Specific provisions Volume 2 Specific provisions Chapter 6 Violations of political discipline Chapter 6 Sanctions for violations of political discipline Chapter 7 Acts that violate organizational discipline and personnel discipline Chapter VII Punishment for acts that violate organizational discipline Chapter VIII Acts that violate provisions on integrity and self-discipline Chapter VIII Punishment for acts that violate integrity discipline Chapter IX Punishment for corruption and bribery Chapter IX Punishment for acts that violate mass discipline Chapter X Acts that undermine the socialist economic order Chapter X Punishment for acts that violate work discipline Chapter XI Acts that violate financial discipline Chapter XI Punishment for acts that violate life discipline Chapter 12 Dereliction of duty and malfeasance Part III Supplementary Provisions Part III Supplementary Provisions (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism General Provisions Highlight and strengthen awareness of the Party Constitution, set up special provisions to implement Party discipline Strengthen the authority of the Party Constitution Effectively connect with national laws Guiding ideology, principles and scope of application 5 articles Disciplinary violations and disciplinary sanctions 10 articles Rules for the application of disciplinary sanctions 11 articles Disciplinary sanctions for Party members who commit crimes 8 articles Other provisions 10 articles (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism Part I General Provisions Chapter I Guiding ideology, principles and scope of application (Articles 1-5) The regulations stipulate the guiding ideology, principles and scope of application of the regulations, highlight the strengthening of awareness of the Party Constitution and the maintenance of the authority of the Party Constitution, and add the provisions that Party organizations and Party members must consciously abide by the Party Constitution, strictly implement and maintain Party discipline, consciously accept the constraints of Party discipline, and modelly abide by national laws and regulations. Chapter II Disciplinary Violations and Disciplinary Sanctions (Articles 6-15) The regulations stipulate the concept of disciplinary violations, the types of disciplinary sanctions and their impact, and change the impact period of serious warnings from one year to one and a half years; add the provisions that if representatives of Party congresses at all levels are punished with probation or above (including probation), the Party organization shall terminate their representative qualifications. (I) Issues at the institutional and mechanism level Part I General Provisions Chapter III Rules for the Application of Disciplinary Sanctions (Articles 16-26) The regulations stipulate the rules for the application of disciplinary sanctions, and list the failure to restrain or stop in the process of centralized discipline rectification as a circumstance of aggravated or aggravated punishment. Chapter 4 Disciplinary sanctions for Party members who violate laws and commit crimes (Articles 27-34) Provisions are made for disciplinary sanctions for Party members suspected of violating laws and committing crimes, and special provisions are set to achieve effective connection between Party discipline and national law. The content of suspending the voting rights, election rights and eligibility for election of Party members who have been arrested according to law is added. (I) Issues at the level of system and mechanism Part I General Provisions Chapter V Other Provisions (Articles 35-44) Provisions are made for the handling of Party members who violate discipline and whose whereabouts are unknown after violating discipline, as well as the execution of disciplinary decisions, and the maximum time limit for handling the corresponding change procedures for positions, wages, etc. after the relevant Party discipline disciplinary decision is made.

The Central Inspection Team represents the Central Committee. The above-mentioned behavior hinders the implementation of the Central Inspection Work, undermines the authority of the Central Committee, and seriously violates political discipline and political rules.

During the construction of the new campus, three Party Committee meetings were held to discuss the \"donation\" of vehicles to the college by construction units, and five vehicles were successively accepted from four winning construction companies; a \"small treasury\" was set up for off-book expenses. The relevant members of the college's leadership team also agreed to collect fines from construction companies for off-book expenses. Wang Pengxian knew that these practices did not comply with the relevant regulations of the Central Committee, but he not only failed to perform the main responsibility of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, but also participated in them, illegally purchasing vehicles and entertaining and giving gifts for the new campus project office and training base. As the head of the Party organization, Wang Pengxian turned a blind eye to the violations under his nose and even actively participated in them. He was indifferent to the Party's concept and relaxed his sense of discipline. In February 2015, the Kashgar District Party Committee decided to give him a two-year probationary period.
